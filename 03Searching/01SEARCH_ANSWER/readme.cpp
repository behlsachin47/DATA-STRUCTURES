INSTEAD OF SEARCHING IN THE INPUTARRYA WE HAVE TO SEARCH IN THE ANSWER SPACE.
wHAT IS ANSWER SPACE ?? => SET OF ALL VALUES THAT ANSWER CAN TAKE....


MONOTONIC FUNCTION: Function that either preserves the order of input or
reverese the order of input.
  eg. x1 > x2; f(x1) >= f(x2) for all x1 and x2 

  eg. x1 > x2; f(x1) <= f(x2) for all x1 and x2


HOW IS THIS RELEVANT IN BINARY SEARCH ?
=> Take a decision at a point that if we can discard a part of search space.
i.e all the elements above or lower than a certain input follows the same
property.
